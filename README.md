#  :video_game:Hangman Game Why:question: & How:exclamation:

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that has been enjoyed for decades. This particular version of the game has been developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript, and is designed to be played by one player. The aim of the game is for the player to correctly guess a random word within a limited number of guesses in order to save the life of a hanging man.

When the game begins, the player is presented with a blank space for each letter in the randomly selected word. The player can then choose a letter by clicking on the corresponding letter button displayed on the screen. If the letter is part of the word, it will be displayed in the correct blank space. If the letter is not part of the word, a part of the hanging man will be added to the display, indicating that the player has made an incorrect guess.

The player has five chances to guess the word correctly before the hanging man is completely drawn, at which point the game is over. If the player correctly guesses the word within the five attempts, they win the game.

Additionally, the game includes pop-ups that inform the player when they have selected a letter that has already been guessed, as well as a pop-up message indicating that the game is over when the player has used all five guesses.

Overall, this version of Hangman is a fun and challenging way to test your vocabulary and guessing skills. With its easy-to-use interface and engaging graphics, players of all ages are sure to enjoy this classic game.
